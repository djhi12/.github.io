            <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I listened to their explainations about the assignment coding.</li>
                <li>I told my group mates that I dropped my second subject, so that I could participate more 
                    effectively in our discussions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What am I going to do next?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>During the week assignment, I'm going to post a bnunch of questions that related to the
                  assignment for me to understand more the concept.</li>
                <li>I will continue reading the chapters that I haven't yet finished reading.</li>
                <li>During the our group discussions, I will strive to participate not just only listening.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What are my blockers?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This week, there's no any blockers for me, since I already dropped my second subject (Advance CSS)
                    for me to focus on the Web Frontend 2. This time I spent most of my time reading and experimenting
                    those chapters, that I haven't yet finished reading.
