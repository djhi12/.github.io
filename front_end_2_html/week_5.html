            <h3>Testing and Debugging | Chapter 10</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there.</li>
                <li>A ninja programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to 
                  identify and deal with them quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>System error</b> ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
                <li><b>Programmer error</b> ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
                </li>
                <li><b>User error</b> ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
                </li>
                <li>Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as 
                  possible and fixed promptly.</li>
                <li>It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the
                   program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exceptions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to
                    deal with the error.</li>
                <li>The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.</li>
                <li>The catch statement lets you handle the error.</li>
                <li>The throw statement lets you create custom errors.</li>
                <li>The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Stack Traces</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error 
                  occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call that causes an error.</li>
                <li> A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify 
                  the original function or method that started the sequence. </li>
            </ul>

                target="_blank">Stack Traces</a></p>

            <h4>Warnings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to 
                  crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it
                  can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue
                  running incorrectly.</li>
                <li>Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in various environments. Some browsers will 
                  show a small icon in the corner of the browser window to indicate that an exception or warning has
                   occurred. Others require the console to be open to see any warnings or exceptions.</li>
                <li>When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the JavaScript code
                   will stop working in the background, which isn’t always obvious at first. If a warning occurs, 
                   the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.</li>
                <li>For this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in 
                  development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly.</li>
                <li>In production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully (although not 
                  completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so the user experience is not 
                  affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, 
                  and code is tested rigorously.</li>
