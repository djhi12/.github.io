JavaScript Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future. Promises allow us to write cleaner and more readable code for handling asynchronous operations.

A Promise can have three states:

    Pending: The initial state, when the Promise is created.
    Fulfilled: The state when the Promise is resolved successfully, with a result value.
    Rejected: The state when the Promise is rejected, with a reason for the failure.

Promises have two main methods: then() and catch(). The then() method is called when the Promise is fulfilled, and the catch() method is called when the Promise is rejected.

Here's an example of a Promise that fetches data from a server:

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

In this example, the fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves with a response object. The then() method is called on this Promise to extract the JSON data from the response, and then another then() method is called to log the data to the console. If there is an error, the catch() method is called to log the error to the console.

Promises are an important tool for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and are widely used in modern JavaScript code.
