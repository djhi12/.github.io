# area = pi*r^2

# pi = 3.14

# radius =  Circumference/2*pi

# Circumference = 2*pi*radius

# velocity Formula
    # velocity = diplacement/time
    # time = diplacement/velocity
    # diplacement = velocity * time

# Note: Diplacement means difference between the ending and starting positions of an object
