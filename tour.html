                <p class="paragraph-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palancar_Reef" target="_blank">Palancar Reef</a> is a 
                large coral reef on the southwest side of the island of 
                Cozumel and is part of the Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park. The site, popular with scuba 
                divers, is divided into several sections based on depth and coral formations. Dive depths range 
                from 50 to 110 feet (15 to 34 m), with coral swim-throughs in many places.</p>

                   <p class="paragraph-2">While the island 
                    is not particularly well known for its beaches, there are beautiful areas of magnificent powdery 
                    white sand, a by-product of the numerous coral reefs surrounding the island. Among the most popular

                    <p class="paragraph-2">Of note on the east side, which opens to the Caribbean Sea, are Playa Encantada, Playa Hanan, 
                    Punta Morena, Playa Chen Río, and Playa Chiqueros. Also worth a visit are Playa Mia Grand Beach 
                    Park, a popular spot for snorkeling due to its easy access to the coral reefs at El Cielo.</p>

                    (Spanish pronunciation: [san mi'ɣel de kozu'mel]) is the largest city in Cozumel Municipality in 
                    the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. With a 2010 census population of 77,236 persons, it is also 
                    Quintana Roo's fourth-largest community, after Cancún, Chetumal, and Playa del Carmen. It is a
                    hub for tourism on the Riviera Maya, providing the sole ferries between the Mexican mainland 
                    and the island. In addition to the ferry service to Playa del Carmen, the first international
                    cruise terminal in Quintana Roo is located in the city.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-3">The International Pier has an international cruise wharf of 271 meters and a dolphin at 45 
                    meters, giving it the ability to receive two cruise ships at once: the exterior band can 
                    receive voyager class ships of 140,000 displacement tons, and the interior band can receive 
                    ships up to 85,000 displacement tons. A tender wharf is used to receive minor boats at the 
                    terminal.</p>

                    Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park</a> is off the coast of the island of Cozumel in the state of 
                    Quintana Roo, Mexico. The Cozumel reef system is part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, 
                    the second largest coral reef system in the world. Even though almost the entire island 
                    of Cozumel is surrounded by coral reefs, the park only encompasses the reefs on the south side 
                    of the island. It begins just south of the International Pier and continues down and around 
                    Punta Sur and up just a small portion of the east side of the island. The park contains both 
                    shallow and mesophotic coral reefs and extends to the 100 m depth isobar.
                    </p>

                <p class="paragraph-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gervasio_(Maya_site)" target="_blank">
                    San Gervasio</a> is an archaeological site of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, 
                    located in the northern third of the island of Cozumel off the northeastern coast of the Yucatán 
                    Peninsula, in what is now the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. San Gervasio's pre-Hispanic name was
                    Tantun Cuzamil, Mayan for Flat Rock in the place of the Swallows. The ruins were once a hub of
                    worship of the goddess Ix Chel, an aged deity of childbirth, fertility, medicine, and weaving. 
                    Pre-Columbian Maya women would try to travel to San Gervasio and make offerings at least once in
                    their lives. In 1560, the Spanish historian, Diego Lopez de Cogolludo, wrote: "The pilgrims 
                    arrive at Cozumel for the fulfillment of their vows to offer their sacrifices, to ask help for 
                    their needs, and for the mistaken adoration of their false gods." The bishop of Yucatán, Diego 
                    de Landa, wrote in 1549 that the Maya "held Cozumel in the same veneration as we have for
                    pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Rome, and so they used to go to visit and offer presents there, as
                    we do to holy places; and if they did not go themselves, they always sent their offerings."</p>

                    of the island and its people, from its formation millions of years ago to its current status as 
                    one of the Caribbean's most visited tourist destinations.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-6">In addition to its multi-media displays and permanent collections of ancient artifacts, 
                    the museum also hosts numerous temporary exhibits, including artwork from both international 
                    and local artists. Of particular interest is the exhibit dealing with marine life, as well as a 
                    mock-up of the traditional Mayan homes that were once common across the island (there's also an 
                    on-site restaurant).</p>

                <p class="paragraph-9">Thanks to its coral reefs and crystal clear waters, there's no shortage of fun 
                    wildlife encounters on Cozumel. One of the best is <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/cozumel-mex-qr-coz.htm"

                    facility's enclosed bays where you'll learn many fascinating facts about these passive beasts, 
                    including a chance to feed and touch them.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-9">Afterwards, you can swim with them as they glide around you (admission includes all equipment 
                    and use of the beach). Hot Tip: As with many of Cozumel's top tourist sites, the island's 
                    animal attractions get extremely busy when the cruises ships are in port—be sure to enquire 
                    about the less busy times when booking.</p>

                    southernmost tip of the island in the nature reserve known as Parque Punta Sur and is worth 
                    the visit and the climb of its 134 steps for its wonderful views over the Caribbean Sea. It's 
                    a fun little excursion and perfect for those looking for something that is typically not

                    popular dolphin experiences worth considering. One of the best on the island can be enjoyed 
                    at  <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/cozumel-mex-qr-coz.htm" 
                    target="_blank">Dolphinaris Cozumel</a>, which offers an exciting program of dolphin swims. 
                    Packages should be booked in advance (remember, these places are popular with cruise ship 
                    vacationers, too) and are suitable for families traveling with kids, as the waters are shallow. 
                    The experience includes up-close encounters with these remarkable creatures, as well as use 
                    of on-site facilities including restaurants, change rooms, and souvenir shops. ,</p>

                <p class="paragraph-11">Another top-rated attraction on the island is Dolphin Discovery Cozumel. Situated in Chankanaab 
                    National Park, the location itself is stunningly beautiful and, with its reefs, makes for an 
                    excellent place to linger and try your hand at some snorkeling or diving. A variety of dolphin 
                    experiences are offered, including some with swimming fun as they tow you through the water. 
                    Other creatures you'll meet here include manatees and sea lions. As with the Dolpinaris 
                    experience, be sure to plan ahead to avoid disappointment.</p>
